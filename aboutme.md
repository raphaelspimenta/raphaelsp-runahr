## Raphael Souza Pimenta

I am a senior frontend developer who loves new challenges.

I have been in the market for about 10 years and have worked with various technologies. In my first projects, I worked as a backend and as the famous fullstack. I fell in love with frontend on an opportunity I had at the startup that I worked for.

Today, I seek to develop in leadership and application architecture.
